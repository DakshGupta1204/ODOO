# Skill Swap Platform
A platform designed to connect people who want to learn new skills with those willing to share their expertise. Our goal is to create a space where anyone can learn anything from anyone, anywhere. By listing your skills and requesting to learn others, you become part of a supportive community that grows together, helping each other and expanding horizons.

Key aspects:
- Learn from anyone, anywhere: Break down barriers and access knowledge from a global network
- Share your skills: Teach what you know and help others grow
- Request new skills: Find people who can help you learn something new
- Build a supportive community: Foster connections that encourage personal and collective growth

This platform is about more than just exchanging skills‚Äîit's about building a network of people who support and uplift each other, evolving together as lifelong learners.

## üåê Overview
This project was developed by **Team 1760** as an educational initiative to explore and implement the core components of a modern web application. Our primary goal was to create a robust platform by integrating cutting-edge technologies across the frontend, backend, database, and machine learning domains.

**Project Overview**
We set out to design a full-stack web application that demonstrates how different layers of technology can work together to deliver a seamless user experience. The project emphasizes modularity, scalability, and real-world applicability, encouraging team members to learn and apply best practices in web development.

**Technologies Used**

**Frontend**
- React.js: For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces
- TypeScript: To add static typing and improve code reliability
- CSS Modules: For modular and maintainable styling

**Backend**
- FastAPI: For handling server-side logic, RESTful APIs, and managing server routes efficiently with Python.
- Python: The primary language powering the backend, including business logic and machine learning integrations.

**Database**
- PostgreSQL: Used for structured, relational data management where needed

**Machine Learning Integration**
- Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow): For developing and training machine learning models
- Flask: To expose machine learning models as REST APIs
- Model Deployment: ML models are trained in Python and integrated into the backend

**Key Learning Outcomes**
- Full-stack Integration: Gained hands-on experience connecting frontend, backend, and database layers
- API Development: Built and consumed RESTful APIs for seamless data flow
- Machine Learning in Production: Learned to incorporate Python-based ML models into a web app
- Collaboration: Enhanced teamwork and code collaboration using modern development workflows

Our vision is to leverage these modern technologies to empower anyone to learn anything from anyone, anywhere, while fostering a supportive, ever-evolving community of learners and contributors.
